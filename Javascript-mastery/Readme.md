# JavaScript Skill Mastery

Welcome to my JavaScript Skill Mastery project! In 2023, I am determined to master and sharpen my JavaScript skills for my web development work. Last year, I realized that I didn't spend enough time on JavaScript and jumped straight into frameworks like React. This year, I am taking a step back and focusing on the basics.

<!-- ## Learning Resources

To help me achieve my goal, I am learning from an excellent teacher, Hitesh Choudhary, and his fantastic YouTube playlist on JavaScript. The playlist covers a wide range of topics, including JavaScript basics, advanced concepts, and practical applications. I highly recommend this resource to anyone looking to improve their JavaScript skills.

## Project Goals

My goals for this project are as follows:

- Develop a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
- Apply my knowledge to real-world projects and use cases.
- Share my learning journey with the community and contribute to open source projects.
